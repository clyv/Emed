The main goal of this project is to make an automated system to carry out different operations of a medical store. The system will provide the ease, comfort of use to the customer buying medical supplies by performing all work on the computer system. This approach helps reduce the time taken in finding the medicine and also provides the user with information about the medicine. The medicines will be rated amongst others using Sentiment Analysis, ie, based on previous customersâ€™ reviews and comments on the medicines, the products would accordingly be suggested to the new customers.
